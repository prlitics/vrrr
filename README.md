# Voter Registration Records Reader (vrrr)

This package is currently under development. If I had to put a number on it, I'd say we're in something like version 0.0.0.1. 


All of the current development is taking place in the `building_package` repository. `package` is reserved for when it is ready to take on the format and structure of an actual R package.
